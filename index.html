				<h2>Chicago Irish Punk Rock</h2>
				<p>The Fisticuffs were an Irish folk punk band from Chicago formed in 2005.  Their musical stylings have been compared to 
					The Pogues, Flogging Molly, and Dropkick Murphys.  Their unique sound coupled traditional punk rock instrumentation 
					(guitar, bass, and drums) with traditional Irish folk instrumentation (mandolin, violin/fiddle) to create a sound that 
					was far from traditional.  Longtime guitar player, Sean Moriarty, left to move out to Arizona in 2013.  Marcus Madel 
					stepped in on guitar and the band continued to wreak havoc throughout the Midwest until 2015, when lead singer and 
					founding member, Bob Baldwin, left and the band disbanded.</p>
